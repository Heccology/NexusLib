# HeccoLib version 1.1.3

## Changes
- Refactored NLFuelRegistry and NLToolActions
- Added a registry for default entity attributes
- Added a registry for post-process shader effects
  - Provide the condition for when to apply the shader, the directory to the core shader json, and when it can be disabled by the f4 key
  - Fixed a vanilla issue where post-process effects would be disabled when opening the gamemode switcher
- Fixed a typo in the method name of "sendToServer"
- Fixed an issue on neoforge where if two different mods that use Nexuslib for registry are loaded together, the former will register its content under the latter's id
- Added a registry method for non-simple particle types
- Added a registry for force loading models
- Added a registry for item model overrides
- Added a registry for commands
- Added NLParticleRenderTypes
  - Adds `PARTICLE_SHEET_CLOUD` particle render type
    - Translucent render type that doesn't have some visual glitches that normal translucent particles do when rendering over each other, is typically used for "clouds" of one type of particle or when many are meant to overlap each other. It does have issues with depth sorting though, so its not great for other applications.
